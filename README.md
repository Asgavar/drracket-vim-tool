DrRacket Vim Tool
=================

This plugin adds vim-like editing to the definitions area of DrRacket.

Note: this software is alpha quality, but if you'd still like to try
it anyway, follow these steps:

  * `git clone git://github.com/takikawa/drracket-vim-tool.git`
  * `raco pkg install drracket-vim-tool/`
  * Now when you load DrRacket, you should see a vim option in the
    Edit menu. Click that to enable vim mode.

This plugin is released under the GPLv3. Patches welcome.
